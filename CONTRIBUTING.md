How to Contribute
=================

## Pull Requests

Generally we like to see pull requests that:

-   Maintain the existing code style
-   Include usage examples (e.g. how to use new features or before and after examples that demonstrate the change to existing features)
-   Are focused on a single change (i.e. avoid large refactoring or style adjustments in untouched code if not the primary goal of the pull request)
-   Have [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
-   Have tests
-   Don't decrease the current code coverage
